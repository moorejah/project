        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>The creation of this website was for a class project at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. This project helped us realize that data and code are no longer just for programmers. Policymakers, from members of congress to analysts and executives, need to be equipped with the necessary skills to navigate government in the 21st century. Working on this project as a team gave us hands-on experience with programming, data, software development, agile management methods and processes, open source collaboration, and technology innovation. Specifically, we have become familiar with technologies that are a part of the modern programmers toolkit including the command-line, github, the structure of a web application, the linux filesystem, data standards (json, XML, etc.), cloud technologies, and databases. The members of our project team are as follows: </p>
